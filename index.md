## Follow Formula 1? This is how actuarial techniques can keep the motorsport on track

Formula 1 (F1) is a high-stakes, data-driven sport where split-second decisions and precise calculations can make or break a race. Similarly, actuarial science, with its focus on risk management, forecasting and data analysis, plays a crucial role in optimising financial strategies and allowing organisations to make informed decisions. While the two fields might seem worlds apart, they intersect via data-driven decisions, risk assessments and predictive modelling.

F1 teams, like actuaries, spend endless hours analysing data to inform their decisions. Whether it’s tyre degradation, car performance or crash likelihood, actuarial principles are applied across the board. With the right statistical tools, teams can predict outcomes, plan pit stops and optimise performances. So, how does it work?

### Modelling in F1

Data-driven models guide F1 decisions on and off the track, from predicting tyre degradation to managing crash risks and calculating race strategies. They include:

- **The Kaplan-Meier survival model** – actuarial tools such as the Kaplan-Meier survival model, commonly used in survival analysis, resemble the techniques that F1 teams such as Mercedes use to predict tyre degradation and plan pit stops based on performance data.
- **Weibull analysis** – in actuarial science, the Weibull distribution is widely used to model the failure rates of components; for example predicting when a lightbulb might burn out. F1 teams apply similar reliability modelling techniques to predict when car parts, especially tyres, might wear out or fail under stress.
- **Monte Carlo simulations** – these allow teams to simulate thousands of race outcomes by varying inputs such as tyre wear, weather and fuel load. It’s a virtual crystal ball for predicting race dynamics and fine-tuning strategy.

### The actuarial side

Beyond the racetrack, actuarial science supports F1 finances. With millions of pounds at stake, teams and organisers depend on actuaries for risk management.

#### Insurance

- **Event insurance** – actuaries evaluate weather and cancellation risks for races, as seen during the disruption caused by the Covid pandemic
- **Driver insurance** – crash data and driving behaviour help to determine premiums
- **Equipment insurance** – models assess failure risk and optimise cover for costly car parts.

> F1 is a high-speed exercise in risk management and decision making

#### Sponsorship valuation

Sponsorships are a huge revenue source in F1. Actuaries can use predictive models to measure return on investment by tracking fan engagement, media exposure and brand visibility – one of the important factors behind McLaren’s rise in sponsorship revenue in 2021.

### Strategy in action

Lando Norris’s decision to stay on slick tyres in the rain while Lewis Hamilton pitted for intermediate ones during the 2021 Russian Grand Prix is a textbook case for actuarial analysis. Hamilton’s strategy won him the race, while Norris fell from first to seventh. Actuarial tools that could have helped Norris include:

- Monte Carlo simulations could predict rising lap-time losses as rain intensified
- Decision trees would weigh the cost-benefit of different pit strategies
- Expected loss models could estimate race time lost under various choices.

Real-time solutions could also have contributed, including:

- **Bayesian updating** – incorporating real-time weather and track data could have triggered an earlier pit call
- **AI predictive tools** – historical wet-race data could guide optimal pit-stop timing, helping to avoid costly missteps.

The wrong decision possibly cost McLaren heavily in Constructors’ Championship points – a reminder that, in F1, timing is everything.

### The finish line

F1 is more than just car racing, it’s a high-speed exercise in risk management and decision-making. Actuarial science, with its emphasis on data analysis and risk modelling, can play a crucial role in helping F1 teams make informed split-second decisions. Whether it’s predicting tyre wear, managing insurance risks or optimising sponsorship revenue, actuaries can help to drive success both on and off the track.

In the fast-paced world of F1, every second matters. And just like an actuary calculating risk, every decision can be the difference between crossing the finish line first and falling behind.

In F1, the data tells a story, and every winning lap is a lesson in uncertainty.

This is the 75th year of the Formula 1 World Championship. The season started in March in Melbourne and ends in December in Abu Dhabi.  
There are 24 races, in 21 countries. Six are Sprints – a formula introduced five years ago. A Sprint is shorter, about a third of the usual distance, and lasts about 30 minutes, with no mandatory pit-stops, unlike in Grands Prix.  
To make the necessary travel around the globe more efficient, some races are now on successive weekends on nearby circuits; these are known as double- or triple-headers.  
For the first season in 1950, there were just seven races: six in Europe and one at the Indianapolis 500 track in the US (which most drivers skipped). Four circuits that featured back then are still on the F1 calendar: Monaco, Monza, Silverstone and Spa. [Click here](https://www.formula1.com/) to find out more.
